 # Project description
 
 This Github repository is a contribution to the ACIT4610 master course. The project consists of using evolutionary cellular automata (CA) and neural networks to control a pole cart using OpenAI Gym. 
 
 Contributins in this project are twofold:
 
 1) An evolutionary Cellular Automata controller using a genetic algorithm can be found in the folder denoted "CA_controller".


 2) The second case study investigates Neuroevolution using the NEAT algorithm to evolve a feedforward neural network to control the cart pole. Project code is found in the folder denoted "NEAT_controller folder".
